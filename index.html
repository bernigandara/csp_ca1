                        Sony began in the wake of World War II. In 1946, <em>Masaru Ibuka</em> started an electronics shop in Shirokiya,<sup>[22]</sup> a department store building in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihonbashi">Nihonbashi</a> area of Tokyo. The company started with a capital of ¥190,000<sup>[23]</sup> and a total of eight employees.<sup>[24]</sup> On 7 May 1946, Ibuka was joined by Akio Morita to establish a company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (東京通信工業, Tōkyō Tsūshin Kōgyō) (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation).<sup>[25]</sup> The company built Japan's first tape recorder, called the Type-G.<sup>[25][26]</sup> In 1958, the company changed its name to "Sony".<sup>[27]</sup>
